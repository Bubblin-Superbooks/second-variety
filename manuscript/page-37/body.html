Down in a hole under the ruins of a town. With radiation pools and claws, and Russian dive-mines up above, coasting around in the sky.</p><p>“Where are we going?” David asked.</p><p>“To the Russian lines.”</p><p>“Russian?”</p><p>“The enemy. The people who started the war. They dropped the first radiation bombs. They began all this.”</p><p>The boy nodded. His face showed no expression.</p><p>“I’m an American,” Hendricks said.</p><p>There was no comment. On they went, the two of them, Hendricks walking a little ahead, David trailing behind him, hugging his dirty teddy bear against his chest.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">About four in the afternoon they stopped to eat.</p></div> </div>
